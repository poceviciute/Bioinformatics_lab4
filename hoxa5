HOXA5 is a gene that is part of the A cluster on chromosome 7 and encodes the Homeobox Hox-A5 protein. It encodes a DNA-binding transcription factor that regulates gene expression, morphogenesis, and differentiation. Since the protein that HOXA5 encodes upregulates a tumor supressor, the protein may be important for tumor formation. HoxA5 is suppressed in acute myeloid leukemia.
